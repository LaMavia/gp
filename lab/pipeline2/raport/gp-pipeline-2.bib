              ascomycetous yeast genera Brettanomyces, Debaryomyces, Dekkera, and
              Kluyveromyces was performed by using 18S rRNA gene sequence
              analysis. Our comparative sequence analysis revealed that
              Brettanomyces anomalus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis were closely
              related to one another and also to their teleomorphs, Dekkera
              anomala and Dekkera bruxellensis, respectively. Together with
              Dekkera custersiana and Dekkera naardenensis, these four species
              formed a stable and distinct phylogenetic group. The three
              representative species of the genus Debaryomyces examined (viz.,
              Debaryomyces castellii, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Debaryomyces
              udenii) were found to be genealogically highly related to each
              other and exhibited a specific phylogenetic affinity (level of
              sequence similarity, approximately 99.2%) with Candida
              guilliermondii (telemorph, Pichia guilliermondii). Debaryomyces
              species and C. guilliermondii formed a distinct phylogenetic group,
              which displayed a significant association with a phylogenetically
              coherent cluster encompassing Lodderomyces elongisporus, Candida
              albicans, and four other Candida species. In contrast to the
              situation with the genera Brettanomyces and Debaryomyces, the genus
              Kluyveromyces displayed very marked phylogenetic heterogeneity.
              Kluyveromyces polysporus, the type species of the genus
              Kluyveromyces, and six other Kluyveromyces species (viz.,
              Kluyveromyces africanus, Kluyveromyces delphensis, Kluyveromyces
              lodderae, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Kluyveromyces waltii, and
              Kluyveromyces yarrowii) were phylogenetically intermixed with
              species of the genera Zygosaccharomyces, Saccharomyces, and
              Torulaspora. In contrast, Kluyveromyces aestuarii, Kluyveromyces
              dobzhanskii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces wickerhamii, and
              three Kluyveromyces marxianus varieties, along with their anamorph,
              Candida kefyr, formed a highly stable monophyletic group worthy of
              separate generic status. Kluyveromyces blattae and Kluyveromyces
              phaffii formed two distinct phylogenetic lines that did not exhibit
              particularly close affinity with each other or other ascomycetous
              yeast genera. Our phylogenetic findings are discussed in the
              context of the results of other genotypic and phenotypic studies.",

              ask whether a definitive prokaryotic phylogenetic tree exists and
              whether it can be confidently inferred using orthologous genes. We
              analysed an 11–taxon dataset spanning the deepest divisions of
              prokaryotic relationships, a 10–taxon dataset spanning the
              relatively recent ?–proteobacteria and a 61–taxon dataset spanning
              both, using species for which complete genomes are available.
              Congruence among gene trees spanning deep relationships is not
              better than random. By contrast, a strong, almost perfect
              phylogenetic signal exists in ?–proteobacterial genes. Deep–level
              prokaryotic relationships are difficult to infer because of signal
              erosion, systematic bias, hidden paralogy and/or HGT. Our results
              do not preclude levels of HGT that would be inconsistent with the
              notion of a prokaryotic phylogeny. This approach will help decide
              the extent to which we can say that there is a prokaryotic
              phylogeny and where in the phylogeny a cohesive genomic signal
              exists.},

              preferred method and use it in further analysis; however,
              undetected alignment bias can be problematic. I describe Muscle5, a
              novel algorithm which constructs an ensemble of high-accuracy
              alignment with diverse biases by perturbing a hidden Markov model
              and permuting its guide tree. Confidence in an inference is
              assessed as the fraction of the ensemble which supports it. Applied
              to phylogenetic tree estimation, I show that ensembles can
              confidently resolve topologies with low bootstrap according to
              standard methods, and conversely that some topologies with high
              bootstraps are incorrect. Applied to the phylogeny of RNA viruses,
              ensemble analysis shows that recently adopted taxonomic phyla are
              probably polyphyletic. Ensemble analysis can improve confidence
              assessment in any inference from an alignment.},
