  ABSTRACT = {Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a multi-host morbillivirus whose
              evolution and host-switching capacity are largely determined by its
              hemagglutinin (H) gene. To reconsider the molecular evolution of
              this critical gene, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic,
              selection, and structural analyses on a curated dataset of 68
              representative global H gene sequences. Our phylogenetic
              reconstruction confirmed the segregation of sequences into distinct
              , geographically associated lineages. To provide stronger evidence
              for viral adaptation, we performed a site-specific selection
              analysis, which identified 15 amino acid sites in the H protein
              undergoing significant episodic positive selection. Crucially, the
              majority of the known SLAM and Nectin-4 receptor-binding residues
              were found to be among these positively selected sites. We further
              contextualized these findings by mapping the sites onto a 3D
              homology model of the H protein, which confirmed their location on
              the exposed surfaces of the receptor-binding domain. This
              compilation provides quantitative evidence that the key functional
              regions of the H protein are direct targets for adaptive evolution,
              which has significant implications for understanding host tropism
              and the ongoing challenge of vaccine mismatch.},
